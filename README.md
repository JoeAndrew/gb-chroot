## Gentoo Build Chroot
Gentoo Build `Binpkg if you will` Chroot is a collection of scripts, that ease managing chroot environments for building Gentoo's `binpkgs`.

This might get in handy if you have a number of similar hardware and need to build and distribute similar `binpkgs`. Or if you have a powerful/efficient/whatever-that-is system, that could be used to build `binpkgs`
