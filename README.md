## Gentoo Build Chroot
**Gentoo Build** `Binpkg if you will` **Chroot** is a collection of scripts, that ease managing chroot environments for building Gentoo's `binpkgs`.

This might get in handy if you have a number of similar systems and need similar `binpkgs` for them. Or if you have a powerful/efficient/whatever-that-is system, that could be used to build `binpkgs`.

To get started, read the [Documentation](https://pf4public.github.io/gb-chroot/).
